    <div class="main2">
    Focus on Franklin began as a social entrepreneurship class project in the fall of 2017. The concept at the time was simple: a website with stories from Chapel Hill's homeless residents with an opportunity for direct interpersonal donation. As we worked, we developed relationships with the experts at the Inter-Faith Council for Social Service, Community Empowerment Fund, and Orange County Partnership to End Homelessness. We soon realized that there was more important work for our team to do; when we discovered that there was no specific diversion funding in Chapel Hill, we pivoted our organization's mission to fill the void. We have continued to tweak and grow our concept after the class ended. Today, we are a registered 501(c)3 and proud to be an integrated part of Chapel Hill's network of organizations working to end homelessness.</div>

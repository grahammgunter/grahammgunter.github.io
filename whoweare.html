               <li>Diversion is one of the central gaps in homelessness assistance in Chapel Hill.</li>
               
               <li>Before Focus on Franklin, a stable funding for diversion did not exist in Chapel Hill.</li>
               
               <li>With the help of our partner organizations and donors, we estimate that with $6,250 we can divert 25 households, 10% of the Chapel Hill homeless population, from becoming homeless per year.</li>

        <div class="info2">
            <ol>
                <li>Q: What is the difference between diversion and prevention?
A: Prevention is an overall strategy to avoid homelessness while a diversion effort is employed three days before or two weeks after experiencing homelessness.
</li>
           <li>Q: How many people in Chapel Hill are homeless? 
A: 152 regularly but up to 250 people experience homelessness in Chapel Hill every year.</li>
           <li>Q: What is an example of a FOF diversion effort? 
A: An individual in Chapel Hill will become homeless if they cannot travel to live with their family in New York. FOF purchases a bus ticket for them, enabling them to reach their family and secure stable housing.</li>
          <li>Q: Are all potential homelessness cases in Chapel Hill divertable?
A: No, around 10% of all cases are divertable. With FOF's funding, we hope to meet this 10% and increase the number of divertable cases. </li>
          <li>Q: How much does each diversion case cost?
A: Every case is different. Efforts can range from buying a week's worth of groceries to ease tension within a household to paying an individual's utility bill to avoid eviction.</li>
           <li>Q: Which city is particularly skilled at diversion?
A: Cleveland, Ohio has an exceptional diversion system, diverting around 25% of all homelessness cases. FOF aims to meet this standard. </li>

        <div class="aside">
            <ol>
                <li>Mass homelessness is not inevitable. It has a beginning, causes, and a solution.</li>
                <li>The homeless face undue stigma. They are not a separate class; they are experiencing a housing crisis.</li>
                <li>Housing is a basic human right.</li>

                <li>Chapel Hill lags behind the rest of the state in our homelessness system.</li>
                <li>We are the only county in which rates of homelessness have gone up in the last eight years. </li>
                <li>Our hope is that if people know to treat homelessness like the crisis it is, we can reverse this trend.</li>
